## HEAD (Unreleased)

- Update dependencies to allow for both 1.x and 2.x versions of `@pulumi/docker`
- Update awsx dependency to use version that supports peer dependencies for aws and pulumi

## 0.20.0 (Release April 20, 2020)

- Update dependencies to allow both 1.x and 2.x versions of `@pulumi/pulumi`, `@pulumi/aws`
- Update dependencies to allow both 2.x and 3.x of `@pulumi/azure`

  Note that this is a breaking change in `@pulumi/cloud-aws` as a result of removing synchronous calls:
  `network.getDefault()` now returns a `Promise<Network>` instead of `Network` and
  `shared.getOrCreateNetwork()` now returns a `Promise<CloudNetwork>`.

## 0.19.0 (Release April 2, 2020)

 - Upgrade to go1.13.x
 - Upgrade to latest version of `@pulumi/awsx`.
 - Upgrade to latest version of `@pulumi/azure`
    
    Note that the version bump for `@pulumi/azure` is a breaking change for users of `@pulumi/cloud-azure`:
    - The underlying type for `Timer.subscription` is now `appservice.TimerSubscription`
    - The underlying types for `Topic.topic` and `Topic.subscriptions` are now `azure.servicebus.Topic` and `azure.servicebus.TopicEventSubscription[]` respectively;

## 0.18.2 (Release November 6, 2019)

- Update `@pulumi/aws` and `@pulumi/pulumi` dependencies to 1.0.0

## 0.18.1 (Release July 15, 2019)

### Important

- This will be the final version of `@pulumi/cloud` before it is deprecated.  Existing
  `@pulumi/cloud` packages will still be available, but are unlikely to get continued fixes or
  support.  Users of these packages are recommended to move to `@pulumi/aws`, `@pulumi/awsx` if you
  use AWS, and `@pulumi/azure` if you use Azure.  These packages lack the abstractions that provide
  a single view over the different clouds.  However, they expose the full set of rich functionality
  each cloud provides.

### Improvements

- Expose log group and task definition for AWS `Service`s
- Updated to latest versions of dependent packages.

## 0.18.0 (Release March 30, 2019)

### Important

- Moves to the new 0.18.0 version of `@pulumi/aws`.  Version 0.18.0 of `pulumi-aws` is now based on
  v2.2.0 of the AWS Terraform Provider, which has a variety of breaking changes from the previous
  version. See documentation in `@pulumi/aws` repo for more details.

## 0.17.1 (Released March 27, 2019)

## 0.17.0 (Released March 5, 2019)

### Important

Updating to v0.17.0 version of `@pulumi/pulumi`.  This is an update that will not play nicely
in side-by-side applications that pull in prior versions of this package.

See https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/commit/7f5e089f043a70c02f7e03600d6404ff0e27cc9d for more details.

As such, we are rev'ing the minor version of the package from 0.16 to 0.17.  Recent version of `pulumi` will now detect, and warn, if different versions of `@pulumi/pulumi` are loaded into the same application.  If you encounter this warning, it is recommended you move to versions of the `@pulumi/...` packages that are compatible.  i.e. keep everything on 0.16.x until you are ready to move everything to 0.17.x.

## 0.16.3 (Released February 22nd, 2019)

- Update @pulumi/pulumi dependency to require at least version 0.16.14 in order
  to improve delete-before-create handling.

## 0.16.2 (Released Novemeber 29th, 2018)

### Improvements

- Fix an issue where `@pulumi/cloud-azure` depended on an outdated development version of `@pulumi/azure`

- When running on Azure, @pulumi/cloud now share a single app service plan across all `cloud.Timer`s in a stack

- Support passing an `Input<string>` as the image name when creating a container
